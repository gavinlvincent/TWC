						             <p>For government agencies, the preferred method of service is via fax, but we will accept service by fax, email, etc., based on your preferred method of service.<br>
						             <br>Legal requests must be signed, dated, and addressed to Time Warner Cable. They should also contain a do not disclose statement to avoid delays in processing. For example: “Time Warner Cable is directed not to disclose this subpoena to any party as such disclosure may interfere with an ongoing investigation.” Please include both a contact number and fax number with your request.<br>
						             <br>When serving a court order or a warrant that is a follow up to a prior preservation request, please include a copy of your prior request so that we can easily locate our pre-existing file in a timely manner.<br>
						             <br>Due to the volume of subpoena requests received by Time Warner Cable, responsive information is generally provided within 10-14 business days. Expedited responses, if resources permit, will generally be provided within 3 business days. Emergency responses are attempted to be made in real time.<br>
						             <br>Finally, please note that we can only provide basic account identifying information for internet or phone subscribers upon service of a subpoena. If you require detailed billing records, e-mail content, cable information, or other similar records beyond identifying information, pursuant to federal law, we will require a court order or warrant, depending on the nature of the records sought.</p>
