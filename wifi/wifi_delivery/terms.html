                                        You must (a) provide accurate and complete WiFi Service sign-in and registration information, (b) provide all equipment (i.e., a WiFi enabled device that meets the technical specifications for the WiFi Service) to connect to the WiFi Service, (c) protect the password, username and security information you use to access the WiFi Service, (d) notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your WiFi Service account, and (e) comply with all applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations, including copyright and intellectual property rights laws, in your use of the WiFi Service.

                                        THE WIFI SERVICE SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON FOR CRITICAL USES. THE WIFI SERVICE USES RADIO TRANSMISSIONS, SO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE WIFI SERVICE IF YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE IS NOT WITHIN RANGE OF AN AVAILABLE ACCESS POINT. EVEN WITHIN A COVERAGE AREA, THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF THE WIFI SERVICE, INCLUDING NETWORK CAPACITY, TERRAIN, TREES, PLACEMENT OF BUILDINGS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE AND ANY DEVICE TO WHICH IT IS ATTACHED. DATA DELAYS AND OMISSIONS MAY OCCUR.

                                        WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES AS TO THE SECURITY OF YOUR COMMUNICATIONS VIA THE WIFI SERVICE OR THAT THIRD PARTIES WILL NOT GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR MONITOR YOUR COMPUTER(S) OR OTHER DEVICES OR ONLINE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS.

                                        If a third party sues TWC based on your use of the WiFi Service, you will indemnify TWC (in other words, make us whole) for any losses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that TWC suffers.

Any such changes to the Terms of Service will be effective upon posting of the revised Terms of Service on the WiFi Service website. Your continued use of the WiFi Service following any change to these Terms of Service constitutes your consent to such change and your agreement to be bound to the Terms of Service as so modified.

                                        We may suspend, restrict or terminate your access to or use of the WiFi Service at any time and for any reason (including if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service or your TWC Customer Agreement) and without prior notice to you, and you agree that we will have no liability to you as a result of such suspension, restriction or termination. We reserve the right to take any steps that we believe are necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify your compliance with these Terms of Service and, where applicable, the terms of your TWC Customer Agreement.

                                        If a court or similar body determines that a portion of these Terms of Service is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portion of these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable portion should be interpreted as closely as possible (consistent with the law in your area) so as to reflect the intention of the original. Except with our prior written consent, you may not transfer or assign to any other person (in other words, make another person legally responsible for) the rights granted by or your obligation to comply with these Terms of Service.
